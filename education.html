    <h3>Waterford Union High School</h3>
    <p>
    From 2013 to 2017, I was enrolled at Waterford Union High School. During these four years, I challenged myself with a diverse course load. These courses varied all the way from AP Chemistry to AP Spanish. Of these AP classes I took, my favorite was AP Economics, which included both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics. Participating in AP Economics was my first experience within the world of Economics and has led me to decide one of my majors as Economics. In addition to classes, I was a trumpet player in both the school band and the school marching band. The school band allowed me to embrace my love for music and even allowed me to perform in the Light Parade at Walt Disney World.

    Waterford was a very small town and the high school reflected that. My graduating class had roughly 250 people in it. As all generic small town high schools do, Waterford had many weird themed days. For example, the school every year had a "Drive your Tractor to School day". However, as you can probably tell, I personally did not have a tractor, so I was never able to participate in it. High school was a very important time in my life. Over the course of those four year, I managed to come out of my shell and really embrace who I was as a person. I owe my group of friends that I had a big thanks as a result of this. No matter what we were doing to make ourselves look like idiots, we still stuck by each other and picked one another up when we were down. Many of these friendships are ones that I am positive will last for life.
